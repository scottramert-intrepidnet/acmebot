## Deployment

Acmebot **v5 is now generally available**. Deploy the latest release with a single click — the template provisions everything required: Function App ([Flex Consumption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan)), Storage, Application Insights, Log Analytics, and optionally a new Key Vault.

The v5 deployment template supports Azure Public only because Flex Consumption is not available in Azure China or Azure Government.
